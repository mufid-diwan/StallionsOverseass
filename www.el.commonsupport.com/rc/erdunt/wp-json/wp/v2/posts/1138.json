The hydrogen agreements also align with the UK\u2019s recently announced commitment to achieve 5GW of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030 and the UAE\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 23.5% compared to business as usual for the year 2030.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blog-details-image-box\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xl-6\">\n<div class=\"single-box\">\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1203\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-1.jpg 360w, http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-xl-6\">\n<div class=\"single-box martop30\">\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1204\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-2.jpg 360w, http:\/\/www.el.commonsupport.com\/rc\/erdunt\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/blog-details-2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blog-details-image-Bottom_text_box\">\n<h2>New Innovation With Workforce<\/h2>\n<h3>Better Sharing State-of-the-Art Facilities &#038; Equipments For Building Refine Energy Unit.<\/h3>\n<p>Our organizational culture&#8217;s basis establishes high expectations for both delivery and performance outcomes accomplished via innovation and customer focus.
