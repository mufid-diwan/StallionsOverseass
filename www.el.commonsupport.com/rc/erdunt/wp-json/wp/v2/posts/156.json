OPEC+ \u2014 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with their allies including Russia \u2014 have been under pressure from top consumers, such as the United States and India, to add extra supplies after oil prices surged 50% this year. However, the oil cartel agreed on Monday to stick to an existing pact to hike oil output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, shrugging off calls to pump more oil.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bottom-text\">\n<p>John Driscoll, chief strategist at JTD Energy Services, said the decision by OPEC+ was a \u201cvery prudent course of action\u201d until one considers the ongoing energy crises and possible supply disruptions. \u201cWhat I think [is] more concerning to everyone out there \u2026 what happens during the winter? Are we going to have another Arctic freeze?\u201d Driscoll told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Asia\u201d on Tuesday.
