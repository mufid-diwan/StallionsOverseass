In April, data from CMIE revealed that contrary to adding new jobs, India has lost half of its existing jobs in manufacturing over the last five years. Further, job losses were seen in all manufacturing sub-sectors, except in the chemicals industry. With agriculture growing its share in total employment by 4% during the same period, it is clear our country has seen a reverse migration from industrial employment back to agriculture \u2013 a type of deindustrialization.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bottom-text\">\n<p>Now, global experience tells us that it is the midsized units with turnover between $50-100 million that generate maximum volume of jobs. While the larger units typically end up pursuing high levels of factory automation; the micro units mostly employ only a handful of skilled workers as we see in the case of handicrafts, textiles, and several other industries.
