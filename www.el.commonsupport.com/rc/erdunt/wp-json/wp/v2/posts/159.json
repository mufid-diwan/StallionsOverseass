It now accounts for roughly 16% of global GDP and 14% of world employment. However, the relative size of the manufacturing sector in an economy changes depending on the economy&#8217;s stage of growth. Manufacturing employment and output both rise rapidly as economies industrialize, but once manufacturing&#8217;s part of GDP peaks\u2014at 20 to 35 percent of GDP\u2014it falls in an inverted U pattern, as does its percentage of employment. The reason for this is that as wages rise, customers have more money to spend on services, and that sector&#8217;s growth accelerates, making it a more vital source of growth and employment than manufacturing.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The global manufacturing sector has had a turbulent decade, with major developing economies shifting into the top tier of manufacturing nations, a severe recession stifling demand, and manufacturing jobs in advanced economies falling at an accelerated rate.
