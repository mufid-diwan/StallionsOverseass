<p>Sometimes it takes a collapse of the system to realize the flaws lying dormant within it. The coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, hasn&#8217;t exactly collapsed the global supply chain, but ripples from the outbreak are sure to affect wide swaths of mainstream commercial activity.&#8221;The Worldwide Business Impact of the Coronavirus,&#8221; recently highlighted a few startling statistics: An alarming 938 of the Fortune 1000 companies had one or more tier-two suppliers in impacted regions in China. More than 90% of all companies globally with tier-one (direct) suppliers in impacted regions were headquartered in the U.S. Coming in second was Canada, with 7.5%.</p>

<div class="bottom-text">
<p>While it&#8217;s typically wise to not concentrate too much manufacturing in one country or region, taking that simple precaution won&#8217;t automatically insulate you in today&#8217;s economy, cautions Harry Broadman, a managing director at Berkeley Research Group and the chair of the firm&#8217;s emerging markets practice. Broadman, who was chief of staff for the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush and subsequently served as assistant United States trade representative under President Bill Clinton, describes an intricate matrix of commercial relationships in today&#8217;s supply chains.</p>

<h2>New Innovation With Workforce</h2>

<h3>&#8220;One of the lessons is that there probably needs to be more attention paid to either redundancies or alternative suppliers should a particular supplier not be available,&#8221; Broadman says.</h4>

<div class="text">
<p>Almost nine years ago to the day, Japan&#8217;s Fukushima region was hit by a magnitude 9.0-earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Not only did the natural disaster cause three nuclear meltdowns at a nuclear power plant, it effectively took offline production facilities that reportedly produced 22% of all 300-millimeter silicon wafers, a vital component in semiconductors, globally. On top of that, as much as 60% of certain necessary auto parts were made in Fukushima. Although the coronavirus is a different beast entirely, it is an ugly surprise from Mother Nature forcing mainstays of the global economy to reexamine their risk tolerances and supply chain dependencies. For Broadman, the fact that the coronavirus isn&#8217;t just hitting some concentrated region is what makes it such a dynamic threat. &#8220;The coronavirus is something that knows no borders and is far more diversified than any supply chain. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing pretty pronounced effects reverberating,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Rising energy consumption necessitates increasing production from unconventional sources such as oil sands. National governments hold or control the majority of the world&#8217;s remaining reserves. Only a small percentage of total world oil reserves are available for private investment, with the majority of these deposits located in Canada&#8217;s oil sands. Canada continues to play an increasingly vital role in addressing rising global energy demand by responsibly developing its oil sands.</p>

<p>To fulfill increased demand until 2040, all of the world&#8217;s energy sources will be required, but there will be a significant move toward cleaner fuels, mainly natural gas. Natural gas resources are not only geographically and geologically diverse, abundant, dependable, and versatile in use (power generation; residential, commercial, and industrial heating and cooking; and even transportation), but it also emits significantly fewer pollutants than coal power generation, including NOx, SOx, particulates, mercury, and up to 60% fewer GHGs</p>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text">
<p>Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, among other oil and natural gas technologies, have revealed massive untapped resources. Over the last decade, these supplies have drastically transformed the energy situation, notably in North America. The use of natural gas is expected to continue to grow quickly. Natural gas is expected to meet nearly 40% of the predicted growth in global energy demand from 2016 to 2040.</p>

<p>Almost nine years ago to the day, Japan&#8217;s Fukushima region was hit by a magnitude 9.0-earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Not only did the natural disaster cause three nuclear meltdowns at a nuclear power plant, it effectively took offline production facilities that reportedly produced 22% of all 300-millimeter silicon wafers, a vital component in semiconductors, globally. On top of that, as much as 60% of certain necessary auto parts were made in Fukushima. Although the coronavirus is a different beast entirely, it is an ugly surprise from Mother Nature forcing mainstays of the global economy to reexamine their risk tolerances and supply chain dependencies. For Broadman, the fact that the coronavirus isn&#8217;t just hitting some concentrated region is what makes it such a dynamic threat. &#8220;The coronavirus is something that knows no borders and is far more diversified than any supply chain. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing pretty pronounced effects reverberating,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>At a time when the absence of jobsis widely accepted as one of the biggest economic challenges for India, it is pertinent for us to see how the manufacturing sector has consistently performed well below its potential when it comes to job creation. In April, data from CMIE revealed that contrary to adding new jobs, India has lost half of its existing jobs in manufacturing over the last five years. Further, job losses were seen in all manufacturing sub-sectors, except in the chemicals industry. With agriculture growing its share in total employment by 4% during the same period, it is clear our country has seen a reverse migration from industrial employment back to agriculture – a type of deindustrialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text">
<p>Now, global experience tells us that it is the midsized units with turnover between $50-100 million that generate maximum volume of jobs. While the larger units typically end up pursuing high levels of factory automation; the micro units mostly employ only a handful of skilled workers as we see in the case of handicrafts, textiles, and several other industries. It is only the midsized units that employ a combination of educated, uneducated, skilled and unskilled workers – which generates mass em<br />

<p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), bp and Masdar announced the signing of strategic framework agreements to expand upon the UAE and UK’s long standing track record of bilateral partnership in sustainability, including the potential development of clean hydrogen hubs in both the UK and UAE at a scale of at least 2 gigawatts (GW). The agreements underscore the partners’ leadership in technology-driven solutions to the global climate challenge as well as a shared commitment to driving new economic opportunity through decarbonization, both domestically and abroad.</p>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text">
<p>Under the terms of the agreements, ADNOC, bp and Masdar will seek to collaborate on UK and UAE clean hydrogen hub development at an initial scale of 1GW in the UAE and 1GW in the UK, building on the UAE’s position as an anchor investor in some of the UK’s largest offshore wind projects. The hydrogen agreements also align with the UK’s recently announced commitment to achieve 5GW of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030 and the UAE’s Nationally Determined Contribution of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 23.5% compared to business as usual for the year 2030.</p>

<p>The global manufacturing sector has had a turbulent decade, with major developing economies shifting into the top tier of manufacturing nations, a severe recession stifling demand, and manufacturing jobs in advanced economies falling at an accelerated rate. Manufacturing, however, is vital to both the developing and developed worlds. It continues to provide a route from subsistence agriculture to improving wages and living standards in the former.</p>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text">
<p>In the latter, it continues to be a critical source of innovation and competitiveness, contributing significantly to R&#038;D, exports, and productivity growth. However, the manufacturing sector has evolved, bringing with it both opportunities and difficulties, and in the new manufacturing environment, neither corporate executives nor policymakers can rely on old approaches.</p>

<p>Manufacturing continues to expand on a global scale. It now accounts for roughly 16% of global GDP and 14% of world employment. However, the relative size of the manufacturing sector in an economy changes depending on the economy&#8217;s stage of growth. Manufacturing employment and output both rise rapidly as economies industrialize, but once manufacturing&#8217;s part of GDP peaks—at 20 to 35 percent of GDP—it falls in an inverted U pattern, as does its percentage of employment. The reason for this is that as wages rise, customers have more money to spend on services, and that sector&#8217;s growth accelerates, making it a more vital source of growth and employment than manufacturing.</p>

<p>Oil prices could experience an “off the charts spike” as winter approaches and OPEC and its allies stick to their earlier pact on oil output, a strategist told CNBC. OPEC+ — the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with their allies including Russia — have been under pressure from top consumers, such as the United States and India, to add extra supplies after oil prices surged 50% this year. However, the oil cartel agreed on Monday to stick to an existing pact to hike oil output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, shrugging off calls to pump more oil.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text">
<p>John Driscoll, chief strategist at JTD Energy Services, said the decision by OPEC+ was a “very prudent course of action” until one considers the ongoing energy crises and possible supply disruptions. “What I think [is] more concerning to everyone out there … what happens during the winter? Are we going to have another Arctic freeze?” Driscoll told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Tuesday. He pointed to the shortage of fuel in the U.K. — with long queues of cars waiting to buy gas, as well as “fist fights.” In the U.K., people have been panic buying fuel, causing shortages, as well as straining the fuel supply chains.</p>

<p>Driscoll said what’s especially worrying is a thin inventory, or if there’s “any kind of supply chain glitch.” Supply chains have been strained by the panic buying of fuel in Britain, and is due in part to a major lack of truck drivers due to Brexit and the U.K.’s new trading relations with the EU. It’s led the U.K. to resort to bringing in the army to deliver fuel.You could see an off the charts spike — that is one scenario out there,” said Driscoll, of oil prices. “I don’t really hear anybody talking about the prospects of a mild subdued winter. I think, given all the uncertainty over weather and climate change, we could be in for a wild ride here.”</p>

Oil has also rallied, and international benchmark Brent crude hovered just below $84 per barrel on Tuesday afternoon. Speaking to CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe” on Tuesday. Benigni said that although there was some seasonality in natural gas prices, current demand pressures had exacerbated the problem.</p>

This is behind schedule.</p>
